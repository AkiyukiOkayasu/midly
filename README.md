# Midly

## Getting started

Usage with `crates.io` is recommended.
First add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```
midly = "0.1"
```

And then the following line to your crate root:

```
extern crate midly;
```

All types to be imported are on the crate root, and they are directly documented in the source (docs.rs)
Check the crate documentation for examples and usage!
